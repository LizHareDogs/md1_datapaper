abstract: |
  The ManyDogs 1 project investigated whether dogs act on human pointing signals as though they are communicative social cues (ManyDogs Project, et al., 2023b). Researchers from 20 research sites across nine countries collected behavioral data from 704 dogs. Here, we present not only the behavior data on the dogs' responses to experimental conditions but also guardian responses to survey questions, including the Canine Behavior and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ, Serpell and Hsu, 2001). This dataset allows for assessing associations among C-BARQ measures as well as connections to the experimental task data and other dog and guardian characteristic data.

## (1) Background
<!-- Provide background to the data (1000 words maximum). This might include aim(s), main question(s) intend to addressed, topics covered and related theory including literature references and acknowledgement of all major uses of the data. This section should not constitute a full literature review of the topic area, but instead help highlight the literature that informed the motivation and purpose behind collection of the data and potential for use. Where broad comments are made and a wide variety of sources are available to evidence these claims e.g., that humour can lead to laughter, or a specific measure has questionable psychometric properties, preference should be given to acknowledge sources of evidence created by communities who are currently being, or have historically been, marginalised or discriminated against. -->
ManyDogs is a research consortium of teams worldwide interested in shared research questions about canine science [@ManyDogsProject.etal.2023]. This consortium actively fosters a dynamic and diverse community and formalizes a transparent and equitable process for proposing and engaging in multi-lab collaborative projects related to canine cognition and behavior. In the first ManyDogs study---named ManyDogs 1 [@ManyDogsProject.etal.2023a], we investigated a question of theoretical importance in canine science: Do dogs act on human pointing signals as though they are communicative social cues? Domestic dogs (_Canis familiaris_) have become a popular animal model for investigations of cognitive evolution and behavior, particularly after they appeared to respond to human communicative cues such as pointing in a way that was more accurate and flexible than other species [e.g., @Brauer.etal.2006]. Though point following behavior in dogs has been widely observed and the subject of scientific study by many over recent decades [@Miklosi.etal.1998; @Soproni.etal.2001; @Hare.etal.2002; @Kaminski.Nitzschner.2013], there is still disagreement as to why dogs follow pointing cues. Is it because they interpret human pointing as socially communicative (**CITE**)? Or is it because dogs have learned to associate human pointing with food rewards [e.g., @Wynne.etal.2008]?

To investigate this question, we used a big team science, single-study approach, modeled after other groups such as ManyBabies [@Frank.etal.2017] and ManyPrimates [@ManyPrimates.etal.2019]. With this method, multiple research teams followed the same experimental protocol, sharing the high cost of behavioral data collection and striving to implement the method in an identical manner. 

Under our main hypothesis, we predicted that when dogs saw a pointing gesture paired with ostensive signals such as eye gaze and dog-directed speech (i.e., calling the dog’s name), they would be more likely to follow the gesture than when no such ostensive cues accompanied the point. If we observed this response across dogs, the result would lend support to the idea that explicitly communicative cues help dogs understand the intention behind the gesture, or that they find ostensive cues necessary for understanding pointing, similar to human children [@Behne.etal.2005]. On the other hand, if no difference was observed in point following across the two conditions (Ostensive vs Non-Ostensive), this result would suggest that dogs indiscriminately follow pointing, perhaps because they have learned to associate it with rewards and not due to understanding the communicative intention underlying the gesture.

In addition to testing our main hypothesis, we took the opportunity offered by multiple labs collaborating on the same study to collect data on sources of inter-lab variability that could influence results. Often, studies by different groups produce inconsistent results [@Rodriguez.etal.2021]. The impact of cultural differences in scientific practice, dog training norms across regions, and of course variation in heritable traits across dog breeds have complicated replication studies carried out by isolated groups, making it difficult to pinpoint the reasons that results differ. By collecting as much information about the testing environments and subject population as we were practically able, we ended up with a rich and robust data set that would support investigation about multiple influences on dogs’ behavior previously out of reach. 

<!-- Our second goal with the ManyDogs Project was to establish a consortium of international canine scientists.  With the successful completion of ManyDogs 1 and the publication of the scientific report, we fulfilled both aims and the data is available for additional investigations through secondary projects. -->


## (2) Methods
<!-- Describe the methods used for data collection including all sub-headings below as deemed relevant. There is no word limit to this section; we are looking for a carefully detailed account of the data collection methods with sufficient detail to allow replication and meaningful secondary use of the data. -->

## 2.1 Study design
**Please describe the overall study design as requested here. This section is not about surveys but general study characteristics.**
_Provide a clear overview of the study design. This should involve broader features, for example whether the data is cross-sectional or longitudinal, from online questionnaires or face-to-face interviews. A clear overview of the central foci and variables of the data should be presented, including differentiation of between- and within-participant dimensions wherever relevant._

The survey with demographic information and C-BARQ trainability questionnaire was translated in n. Languages  and administered through an Internet link provided to all researchers involved. Questionnaire was administered to dog owners and guardians prior to participate in the behavioral study. The survey was their dog’s demographics, guardian demographics, household information, dog communication information, training history, research experience and then we have the training, aggression, fear, and separation related behavior, excitability, attachment, and attention seeking, and miscellaneous which are chasing, chewing, begging, pulling, urinating activity, barking, licking, and things like that and our point following behavior. We used social media platforms to spread an open call to pet owners and guardians on a study and used emails lists to advertise the project. We used C-BARQ questionnaire for collecting information from pet guardians about themselves and their dogs. With the help from the platform github and google forms we were able to collect the data from participants and store it in github for future analysis.

## 2.2 Time of data collection
<!-- Specific time periods in which the data was collected e.g., December 2020-Febuary 2021, or 1st-15th of May 2019. Date of data collection will not be considered an evaluative criteria of the work.  -->
Overall, data were collected between `r as.character(month(sort(data$date)[1], label = TRUE))` `r year(sort(data$date)[1])` and `r as.character(month(sort(data$date[!is.na(data$date)], decreasing = TRUE)[1], label = TRUE))` `r year(sort(data$date[!is.na(data$date)], decreasing = TRUE)[1])`, though research sites differed in when they collected data during that timeframe (collection dates available in dataset).

## 2.3 Location of data collection
<!-- List regions or countries covered by the data with as much detail as is possible e.g. Data was collected in South-East London, UK or at the University of Bologna, Italy. -->
Data were collected in 20 research sites across nine countries (Argentina, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Poland, UK, USA) on three continents (Figure \ref{fig:countries}). A full list and description of research sites is available in Table S1 of @ManyDogsProject.etal.2023a.

## 2.4 Sampling, sample and data collection
<!--Describe the sample, including any basic demographic information collected, such as number of respondents, age (M, SD), educational background, socio-economic status, religion, and any other descriptive factors collected that are relevant to study design e.g., length of tenure if occupational in focus. The sampling strategy adopted should be fully detailed, including any payment or benefits offered to participants for participation. Any data that did not contribute to the final data set e.g. missing data or response rates, should also be reported here where relevant. -->
Across all 20 research sites, teams behaviorally tested `r data_rows` dogs (M:F = `r nrow(data[data$sex=="Male",])`:`r nrow(data[data$sex=="Female",])`, mean ± SD age = `r round(mean(data$age, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)` ± `r apa_num(sd(data$age, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)` years [range = `r apa_num(min(data$age, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)`-`r apa_num(max(data$age, na.rm = TRUE), digits = 1)`]). Approximately `r apa_num(mean(data$desexed=="Yes", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`% of the dogs were spayed or neutered, `r apa_num(mean(data$purebred=="Yes", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`% were purebred (comprising `r length(unique(data$breed))` breeds), `r apa_num(mean(data$owned_status=="Private home", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`% lived in private homes, `r apa_num(mean(data$owned_status=="Group housing (e.g., working dog kennel)", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`% lived in group/kennel housing, and `r apa_num(mean(data$owned_status=="Other", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`% lived in other housing. Complete behavioral data were collected from `r length(data$status[data$status=="Included"])` dogs, and complete survey data were collected from `r length(data$status[!is.na(data$cbarq_miscellaneous_26) & !is.na(data$cbarq_miscellaneous_27)])` dogs. Guardians identified as female (`r apa_num(mean(data$guardian_gender=="Female", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`%), male (`r apa_num(mean(data$guardian_gender=="Male", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`%), and nonbinary/other (`r apa_num(mean(data$guardian_gender=="Other", na.rm = TRUE) * 100, digits = 1)`%) with a modal guardian age range of `r sub(" - ", "-", slice_max(count(data, guardian_age), order_by = n)$guardian_age)` years.

## (3) Dataset description and access
<!-- The following section should relate specifically to the data file(s) being shared. This section has no word limits. Where you have multiple versions e.g., raw and processed data, please provide the following details for each file. -->
The data set contains `r nrow(data)` observations of `r ncol(data)` variables described in Table \ref{tab:displayDescription}. The dataset contains variables supplied by a questionnaire as well as experimental variables. Data provided by each dog's guardian include demographic information about the dog and guardian, responses to questions about the types and frequencies of the dog's training activities, and answers to the Canine Behavior and Research Questionnaire [C-BARQ, @Serpell.Hsu.2001; @Hsu.Serpell.2003]. The first eight questions of the C-BARQ concern trainability, and their answers were used as part of the preregistered analysis of pointing  [@ManyDogsProject.etal.2023a]. After answering the C-BARQ trainability questions, guardians could optout of completing the rest of the C-BARQ questions.

In addition to the data provided by guardians, experimental variables are included in this data set.  These include information about experimental conditions, proportions of correct choices under ostensive and nonostensive conditions and nonostensive conditions, whether the correct and chosen option were on the right side of the dog, and whether the subject completed the experiment and was used in the analysis.

## (4) Reuse potential
The original data from ManyDogs 1 [@ManyDogsProject.etal.2023a] focuses on dog responses in the two-alternative object choice task across warmup, ostenstive, non-ostenstive, and odor control trials. In addition, that dataset includes basic demographics on the dog and guardian, as well as the mean training score from the C-BARQ. The current dataset adds information on dog origin and household, dog training experience, guardian communication practices, and the complete C-BARQ profile. The C-BARQ data in particular are quite rich, with sections on training, aggression, fear, separate-related behavior, excitability, attachment and attention seeking, and miscellaneous problem behaviors. Thus, this dataset allows for assessing associations among all of the C-BARQ measures as well as connections to the experimental task data and the other dog and guardian characteristic data.

A key strength of this data set is its diversity. The data were collected by 20 different research sites in nine countries, allowing the assessment of site effects as well as cultural differences. In addition, while most dogs are kept in private homes, the dataset also includes a subset of dogs kept in group housing at working dog facilities. Finally, when appropriate, breed is included, allowing the exploration of breed differences.

Though the current dataset has expanded survey information about dog and guardian characteristics, the behavioral task data has been summarized at the level of mean choices per subject and experimental condition rather than including individual trial data. Thus, the trial data are not available for analysis in the current dataset. However, the trial data are available in the original dataset, so it is possible to merge the current and original datasets using subject ID as the primary key to gain access to the trial data. An additional limitation is that, though the C-BARQ training survey questions were compulsory for all participants, the remaining questions were optional to ease the survey burden. As a result, `r length(data$continue_cbarq[data$continue_cbarq == "Yes"])` of the `r data_rows` guardians elected to continue on to the optional questions (though not all completed the survey).
